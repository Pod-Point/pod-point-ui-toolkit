git clone git@github.com:Pod-Point/pod-point-ui-toolkit.git
cd pod-point-ui-toolkit
npm install
```

## Gulp tasks

Gulp prod - compiles pages and assets

```bash
gulp
```

Gulp watch - compiles pages and assets and spins up a new development server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with `/dist` as the
document root.

```bash
gulp watch
```
Gulp prod - compiles pages and assets and minifies CSS and JS

```bash
gulp prod
```


## Documentation

Once you have the repo locally, you can access the docs by opening `/dist/index.html`.

Note: Whilst in beta the dist folder is being tracked my git so you don't need to compile to view the documentaion files.
